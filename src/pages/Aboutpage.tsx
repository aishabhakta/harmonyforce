            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1">
              A New World requires a team of 4-7 players who will work together to score as many points as possible after being dropped into a new, unpopulated world.
              The environments vary, including deserts, underwater locations, frozen mountains, or jungle landscapes full of dangers.  
              The game is best played in a **head-to-head** competition with another team, but solo play modifications allow for a thrilling experience!
